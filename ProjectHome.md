<h1>New multi-touch framework for WPF 3.5 from Mindstorm</h1>

<h3>Introducing Breeze</h3>

<b>Breeze for WPF 3.5</b> is a full core framework for multi-touch showing all the internals.  Unlike Windows 7, you can see how the rotate, move and scale actions are interpreted, how the centre of rotation is calculated and change it all to improve and extend.<br>
<br>
Breeze has a load of cool features, some simple docs, a load of source code and a pretty example photo browser.  Breeze for WPF 3.5 is ideal as a core for building multi-touch applications in WPF for Windows XP/Vista and 7, or as a reference implementation to create a new multi-touch application from scratch.<br>
